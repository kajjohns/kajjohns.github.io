      I got my MS degree from IU and now I work as a visiting research associate in the Crustal Deformation group. I am working models of creep front propagation and interseismic creep rate accelerations in Northern Japan where we observed a decadal creep acceleration event prior to the 2011 M9 Tohoku-oki earthquake.
