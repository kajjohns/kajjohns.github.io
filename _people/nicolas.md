   I am a PhD candidate working on active tectonics and crustal deformation modeling. My work integrates geodetic data with numerical models to investigate how surface deformation is accommodated along faults and through distributed off-fault processes in the Earth's crust.

#### **Research interests**

1) **Interseismic Deformation:**  
<ul>  How transient is the deformation observed between earthquakes, as revealed by geodetic measurements? </ul>
2) **Mantle Dynamics:**  
<ul>  What role do mantle processes play in driving present-day surface deformation? </ul>
