    After obtaining my MS degree from IU in 2020, I worked in the oil and gas industry for a few years. I am now back, working in the Crustal Deformation group as a research associate. I am currently focusing on incorporating geodetic observations with mechanical models to understand postseismic deformation associated with the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake in southern California.

I am also focused on migrating various modeling codes from Matlab to Python to improve code availability to other researchers. A selection of codes can be seen in the [Code Packages](https://kajjohns.github.io/codes/) page, on the lab [Github](https://github.com/kajjohns) page, and on my [personal GitHub](https://github.com/jhdorsett).
