      I am a geophysicist who works primarily with geodetic data and numerical and analytical modeling to investigate active deformation of the lithosphere. In particular, I study how deformation within plate boundary zones is accommodated by faulting and folding in the crust and viscous flow in the lower crust and upper mantle.
