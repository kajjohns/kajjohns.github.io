      I am a former graduate student and postdoc in the Crustal Deformation group. I am currently a postdoc at GEOMAR, Germany. I am interested in using different geophysical methods to investigate the spectrum of slip behaviors observed at subduction zones. I am currently developing a probabilistic inversion of interseismic surface velocities for the boundaries of the fully and partly coupled regions of the megathrust faults at Nankai and Cascadia subduction zones.
