      I am a PhD student in the Crustal Deformation group. I am working on reconciling long-term and present-day deformation in Taiwan through modelign and inversions of geodetic data and other measures of longer term uplift. This work is examining mountain building processes from geologic, to geomorphic, to present-day time scales.
