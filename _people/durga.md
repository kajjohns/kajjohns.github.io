      I am a graduate student in the Crustal Deformation group. I am working on interseismic locking models for the Himalaya thrust. Our estimates of interseismic locking have simple physical constraints that control the spatial distriubition of locking and interseismic creep. We also utilize viscoelastic cycle models that account for time-dependent viscous flow in the mantle and in the lower crust under Tibet.
