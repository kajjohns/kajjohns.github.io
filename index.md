# Welcome to IU Crustal Deformation!  

Our research group explores the eartquake cycle through analysis of geodetic data (complemented by other kinds of geophysical and geological observations), mechanical modeling, and inverse methods. We have a number of active projects including:

- Inferring locking and slow slip processes at subduction zones around the world including New Zealand, Cascadia, Northern Japan, and Nankai Japan
- Mountain building processes in Taiwan over a wide range of time scales (earthquake cycle time scales, time scales of geomorphic processes, and exhumation time scales)
- Using geodetic data to infer the portion of strain rates in actively deforming regions due to strain accumulation along faults and off-fault processes
